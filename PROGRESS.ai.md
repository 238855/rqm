# RQM Development Progress

**Generated by Claude Code on November 16, 2025**

## ✅ Completed

### Infrastructure & Setup

- [x] GitHub repository created at github.com/238855/rqm
- [x] Monorepo structure established
- [x] Comprehensive .gitignore for Rust, Go, and Node
- [x] Commitlint + Husky for conventional commits
- [x] AI development guides (copilot-instructions.md, agents.md)

### Documentation

- [x] Main README with project overview and credits to Claude Code
- [x] JSON Schema for YAML validation (docs/schema.json)
- [x] Example requirements file (examples/sample-requirements.yml)
- [x] Go CLI README

### Rust Core Library (rust-core/) - v0.1.0

- [x] Complete type system for requirements
  - RequirementConfig, Requirement, PersonAlias
  - Owner references (email, GitHub, alias)
  - Priority and Status enums
- [x] YAML parser using serde_yaml
- [x] Schema validator using jsonschema
- [x] Graph traversal with circular reference detection
  - Uses petgraph for graph algorithms
  - Cycle detection and reporting
  - Topological sorting (for acyclic graphs)
  - Dependency and dependent queries
- [x] Comprehensive error handling with thiserror
- [x] **19 unit tests - all passing**
- [x] Clippy linting - zero warnings
- [x] Formatted with cargo fmt

### Go CLI (go-cli/) - v0.1.0

- [x] Cobra framework integration
- [x] Viper for configuration
- [x] Root command with version info
- [x] `validate` command (placeholder implementation)
- [x] Dual binary names: `rqm` and `requim`
- [x] Configuration file support (~/.rqm.yaml)

### Commits

- **2 commits** made with conventional commit format
- All tests passing before each commit
- Code formatted and linted

## 🚧 In Progress / Next Steps

### TypeScript CLI (ts-cli/)

- [ ] Initialize with TypeScript
- [ ] Use commander.js or clack for CLI framework
- [ ] Integrate with Rust core (via subprocess or WASM)

### React Web UI (web-ui/)

- [ ] Initialize with Vite or Next.js
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Graph visualization component
- [ ] Requirement browser

### CI/CD

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- [ ] Build automation for all three components
- [ ] Multi-platform binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] **Note**: No automatic versioning/publishing (manual only)

### Integration

- [ ] Wire Go CLI to actually call Rust library
- [ ] FFI bindings or CLI subprocess approach
- [ ] WASM compilation for web usage

## 📊 Statistics

- **Total Lines of Code**: ~1,500+
- **Test Coverage**: 19 unit tests (Rust)
- **Languages**: Rust, Go, TypeScript, YAML, JSON
- **Dependencies**:
  - Rust: serde, petgraph, jsonschema, thiserror
  - Go: cobra, viper

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Requirements as Code**: Treat requirements like source code
2. **Circular Reference Handling**: Robust graph traversal without infinite loops
3. **Type Safety**: Strong typing across all languages
4. **Developer Experience**: Easy CLI and beautiful UI
5. **Validation**: Comprehensive schema validation

## 📝 Notes

- Using semantic versioning starting at 0.1.0
- All components synchronized at same version
- Conventional commits enforced via commitlint
- Claude Code assisted with initial scaffolding and implementation
